"I hope to be strong enough one day to go on wonderous adventures with my friends and make history! For I am Autolycus Atlantiades, adventurer extraordinaire! " -AA
# Backstory

Autolycus was born in the realm of Eilanaat to one of the most notable families in the known multiverse to adventurers- the Atlantiades, who are known for running many of the major adventuring guilds in different realms. However, he had faced many hardships despite his family's notoriety and wealth. His mother died at child birth, and his father who mourned the lost of his wife, scorned his son, only taking care of him due to obligation. As perceived repentance, his father forced the boy to take up his mother's dream of becoming a powerful wizard, forcing upon the boy grueling hours of studying and training to make that lost dream a reality. This turned the boy into a recluse, who would use stories of heroes and legends as a place of comfort and inspiration; something his father would discourage. 

Due to his training, his father predicted he would be ready to apply to Strixhaven University, a prestigious institution in which the Atlantiades family has been donating their money to for generations, at the ripe age of 12. However, the boy attempted to run away the night before his exams and tried to sail the stormy seas of Eilanaat. His father tried to give chase, but due to the rough nature of the seas, an accident ensued and his father died after his ship capsized

After his father's death, Autolycus' grandfather, Garrick Atlantidas, assigned one of his aunts, Lyndis, to care for the boy despite her young age, and he was moved to live with his aunt as a representative of the family in Arcavios. However, Lyndis was about to approach her years of starting Strixhaven University as a student, and went on to concentrate on her studies rather than upkeep her new responsibilities. Autolycus, though left with the money to take care of himself, was lonely and lost on what to do in his new situation, especially since many of his peers would compare him to his aunt and scorn him for his family's status. Feeling extreme pangs of loneliness, he turned to a life of stealing and debauchery, pulling pranks on his fellow neighbors to gain their attention and ire, and to, more importantly, feel like he was not alone. 

During his later teen years, he was inspired by books he decided to pick up again that he used to read as a child to try and make a difference in the world, and decided he would not change by staying at home. So, he decided sneak onto an adventurer's ship, and became a deckhand to these adventurer's for three years upon making an agreement with the ship's captain, Odynerus, to leave the ship after that time period. Under Odynerus' mentorship, Autolycus became a boisterous young man who wanted to bring smiles to people's faces, partially because he found true joy in helping people during his adventures, and partially to hide the pain he carries from his past.

At the end of his three year period with the crew, Odynerus convinced young Autolycus to face his demons and fears by going to the very university his father tried to force him to go to, and to use the knowledge he gains from the university to empower himself to do what he wants with his life rather than let the memories of his past chain him down. Autolycus took the entrance exam and passed with flying colors, and he hopes to make a name for himself, separate from his family's name, as a hero during and after his time at Strixhaven University. 

# Notable Relationships

### NPCs:
- Lyndis Atlantiades: Autolycus has a complicated relationship with his aunt. Due to her years of neglect in his time of need, he holds a bit of resentment to his aunt, and has tried to separate himself from her
	- From recent events, his resentment for her grew, for her recklessness actively harmed the person he cares about most. 
- Euros Delphi: During his time on Arcavios, Euros briefly watched over young Autolycus before his time as the Oracle. Due to Autolycus' treatment of Theodoros, Euros grew some disdain for the boy. Autolycus, understands where this animosity comes from, and though he does not agree with Euros' controlling nature or philosophy on leadership and people, Autolycus respects him for his attempts on trying to do the best for the people he is responsible for. 
- Theodoros Delphi: During his time on Arcavios, Autolycus and Theodoros went to the same school together. Due to Theodoros' lone wolf attitude, Autolycus would pull constant pranks on Theodoros, as a way to try and make friends and a way to try and get Theodoros to smile. However, the pranks would sometimes go too far, and with Theodoros unstable control on the balance of black and white mana with him, would attack Autolycus to use him as an example to not mess with Theodoros. This trouble would put a rift between the two boys. Autolycus developed a fear of Theodoros eventually due to his increasing brutality and hostile attitude.

  However, years later during their time in Strixhaven, Theodoros came to Autolycus one day to request if he could temporarily reside in Autolycus' dorm as a roommate while he tried to figure out new living arrangements. Seeing this as a chance to restart the friendship he always craved between the two of them, Autolycus allowed Theodoros to stay with him.
