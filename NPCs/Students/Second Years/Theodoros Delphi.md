# Backstory
## What Theodoros Knows
According to his father, Euros, he got into an accident as a small child, which caused him to become a conduit of immense black and white mana. However, Theo always had more of a natural affinity to black mana, and because mana in the world of MTG is usually tied to certain traits, it caused him to exhibit more traits of black mana. This was particularly dangerous because black mana represented death and the desire to gain power at any cost. Seeing how Theo could easily become a menace to society if taught the wrong values, Euros taught Theo that he should prioritize having power so that he could protect the people he cares about and that working with people and society's rules will get him the power he wanted in order to channel Theo’s energy into something productive. This also played into him having a balance between black and white mana since white mana embodies harmony and community. 

Due to how unstable Theo's mana could be with his condition and his natural talent for the martial arts, he was raised to be a fighter, and he even learnt how to use his mana to create clones of himself to use in battle. Theo was also prone to violence, especially when his mana was leaning towards black, so his father decided to teach Theo to mute his emotions to try and reign in on his violent tendencies, and even when Theo became more consistently stable, Theo chose to distance himself from his peers to keep the peace and to not risk more incidents.

Theo recently learnt that his father allegedly murdered his mother for power, and after confronting his father about his actions, Theo's world view felt like it has shattered and his current goals as obsolete since, if what he knows so far is all true, his identity and what he was working for were built off the foundations of lies that were spun as a way for his father to control him. 

More specific reasons as to why Theo felt betrayed by Euros:

 - Theo saw this as a major contradiction to the values he was taught his entire life.
 - He felt like he was lied to by his father since his father always told him his mother died for a noble cause.
 - Euros' way of raising Theo was very strict and involved lots of tough love, but Theo always put up with it because he believed his father's ways. With this revelation, it felt like he went through all that pain for nothing. 

However, he has also realized that due to the very secretive nature of his father, he thinks there is a possibility that there is more to his father's situation than he knows. Theo's current goal is to figure the truth of his father's past to see if he should hold on to the last bit of trust he had for Euros and follow the path he has been on, or take action against his father for betraying him if this is all there is to the truth.

Due to the uncertainty he feels in the teachings of his father and doesn't have him to help balance his mana issues, Theo has become unstable again and his mana has been slowly leaning more black as time passes, which has been changing his personality to becoming more callous and more prone towards using violence to establish his power over others. 

### TLDR
Theo has mana issues that used to make him violent and lust for power, but papa Euros tried to get Theo to behave and use his lust for power for good causes. However, due to Euros seemingly building Theo's world views off deceit, Theo has become super weary of Euros and is trying to figure out wether his father is truly an asshole that should be put down or if Euros has just been looking out for Theo and has been hiding info from Theo for some other reason. His distrust of Euros has also caused him to become more unstable and he is slowly turning colder to people as a result of a combo of his mana issues and the fact that he has no one around that he truly trusts anymore. 
*(Fyi people's personalities are usually not this shaped by mana but Theo is a special case and he's supposed to introduce the concept of mana to the players and be an example of what mana is outside being an energy source for magic to the party, as mana plays a larger role in the story later on) 

## His Whole Story
Theodoros was born to Euros and Melpomene Delphi on the realm of Arcavios. One faithful day, while Melpomene took her child to her workplace of Strixhaven to watch over him while she attended business, the three year old Theodoros was led to the secret labs under the Scriptoria Collections by Melpomene's deity, Midius, where some of the professors including Extus, was working o
# How He Plays  
In his current state, he sees people as tools to be used, and emotionally pushes people away. Due to his upbringing, he knows that there are bounds to what he can do within society (ie: killing babies for power or for his goals would upset the large majority of society and would cause more issues for him in the long run), but he only follows societal rules when the cost outweighs the benefits. When Theo is stable, he is not impulsive and tends to calculate solutions that would benefit him for the long term, but if he uses his ability too much or if he loses his patience (which takes a lot), he becomes unstable and will impulsively want to obliterate whatever or whomever triggered him to assert his dominance and instill fear into those around him to discourage other people from going against him (this also triggers him to activate his necrotic shroud). If he is on a mission and people do things that will potentially become an obstacle for completing his task, his first instinct is to intimidate people to put them back in line to what they should be doing. If the actions they take do not obstruct the objective of their mission, he will not care.

# Notable Relationships

## NPCs: 
## Players: 
- Lily: Neutral leaning positive, you and her are currently "business partners" since your goals and her goals align (find Midius, an arch fey Lily is looking for. You are looking for Midius because it seems like your father made some sort of deal with Midius that you want to know more about). You are cordial with her and she is honestly the person you trust most on this team to listen to you if needed, but that doesn't mean she is trustworthy.  She has gotten on your nerves at times due to her making rash decisions purely off emotion, but the gain of working with her outweighs the cost.
-  Zazo: Neutral/slight dislike. Creates useful poisons and listens to orders but is socially inept and a blabber mouth. Also noticed that Zazo seems scared of Theo. 
- Serene: Neutral/slight dislike, best at combat in the group but also socially inept, a snitch, and will disregard orders and run away at the first sign of trouble
- Pista: Negative for almost derailing their entire last mission they went on due to his shenanigans. Pitifully idiotic. Useless and a liability
- Hunugark: Doesn't know
