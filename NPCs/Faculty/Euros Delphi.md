- He grew up in a war torn plane in a land known as Enalios. He grew up in a temple to the goddess of his lands, Niobie, not knowing his birth parents, and he formally studied under the temple attendants to become a healer. He was a shy, but charming young man, but he never felt any close relationship to anyone. When he was of age as a teen, he volunteered to help help heal the wounded who fought in this "war" their people have been fighting for 500+ years
- Strangely enough, he never saw his platoon leave the seas around Enalios, but he saw many try to invade his lands. He would see come and go from his platoon of ships, succumbing to the countless wounds they would obtain in battle, and friends he would meet that would eventually be assigned to travel out of Enalios would never come back. 
- Distraught and sick of seeing the constant death around him, he decided to "follow" an old myth he had heard from all who had lived in Enalios: if you travel into the giant whirlpool in the middle of the Enalios archipelago and survive, you may get your wish granted by Niobe herself.
	- He was on a suicide mission because he was tired of the war and chaos he had to live through every day. Even though he has heard many rumors of weird occurrences happening around the whirlpool and of people who have "claimed" to have survived the whirlpool trip going insane, he thought insanity or death would be better than living the life he currently lived
- He sets off on his trip, only to miraculously live the journey into the whirlpool and travel into the secret lands of Antigonos, where the goddess Niobe resides. However, Niobie tells Euros of how Ahrua Mhazda, the people of Enalios, including him, are people who are made from her dreams, and because she is only a Goddess of Dreams and nothing else, they are not actually real people. When they die, there is no afterlife, only nothingness, and their lives and roles in this world were predestined from Niobe herself. The Enaliosi who leave the archipelagos to fight in the war slowly disappear if they leave for too long.  
- Euros, seeing no reason to live, wished to Niobe to start a new in another world, away from all the bloodshed and lies he has lived. 
	- This opens up the possibility for there being a few people who have escaped the plane of Ahrua Mhazda, which is typically very closed off, but no one else would be Enaliosi except for him, and how he got out of his country would be a closely guarded secret to Euros
