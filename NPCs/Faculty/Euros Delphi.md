- He grew up in a war torn plane in a land known as Enalios. He grew up in a temple to the goddess of his lands, Niobie, not knowing his birth parents, and he formally studied under the temple attendants to become a healer. He was a shy, but charming young man, but he never felt any close relationship to anyone. When he was of age as a teen, he volunteered to help help heal the wounded who fought in this "war" their people have been fighting for 500+ years
- Strangely enough, he never saw his platoon leave the seas around Enalios, but he saw many try to invade his lands. He would see come and go from his platoon of ships, succumbing to the countless wounds they would obtain in battle.
- Distraught and sick of seeing the constant death around him, he decided to "follow" an old myth he had heard from all who had lived in Enalios: if you travel into the giant whirlpool in the middle of the Enalios archipelago and survive, you may get your wish granted by Niobe herself.
	- He was on a suicide mission because he was tired of the war and chaos he had to live through every day. Even though he has heard many rumors of weird occurrences happening around the whirlpool and of people who have "claimed" to have survived the whirlpool trip going insane, he thought insanity or death would be better than living the life he currently lived
- He sets off on his trip, only to miraculously live the journey into the whirlpool
